  <Heading>CHATEAU DE PLEUVILLE</Heading>
  <Text>
    <p>
    Chateau de Pleuville is Susan Lowe and Alan Ward's house in the middle of France.
    </p>
    <p>
The Chateau was rebuilt by the Favre d'Echallens family in the 1860s, when it became a fully functioning and independent country house and farm. It remains largely unaltered and the house and grounds are now being renovated by Alan and Susan.
</p>
Pleuville is a village in the northern Charente, near the towns of Charroux and Confolens. The nearest big cities are Angoulême, Limoges and Poitiers.
